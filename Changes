* v1.08, Sunday, November 9, 2003

   Oops, forgot Mac::AppleEvents::Simple in PREREQ


* v1.07, Sunday, November 9, 2003

   Fix for changed file format in Panther's Script Editor.


* v1.06, Wednesday, June 25, 2003

   Fix PREREQ.


* v1.05, Tuesday, June 24, 2003

   Added call().


* v1.04, Monday, April 21, 2003

   Add support for saving/loading compiled AppleScripts as data in data fork
   instead of resource in resource fork on Mac OS X, for compatability with
   the Mac OS X Script Editor.

* v1.03, Thursday, March 12, 2003

   Tests broken mildly on most systems; corrected.


* v1.02, Thursday, March 12, 2003

   Added Mac OS X support (see Mac::Carbon).

   Fixed bug with scripts not being saved in specified resource ID.

   Don't save component if request for nonexistent one fails.

   Some cleanup.

   Changed load_osa_script() arguments.  Second argument no longer is in
   use. Whether it is a file is determined by virtue of it not being a
   Handle object.  Second argument is now resource ID, unless it is 1, in
   which case we assume you are calling with the old parameters.  If you
   really want to save with resource ID of 1, then add a third parameter of
   "1".  Sorry.


* v1.01, Wednesday, December 4, 2002

   Save scripts as script contexts.  (Bart Lateur)


* v1.00, Tuesday, January 22, 2002

   Changed TEXT to SOURCE in internal hash storing text source of script.

   Added C<source> method (finish adding docs).

   Made calls for generic scripting component to %ScriptComponents
   make new call to OpenComponent each time.

   Bump version info.


* v0.51, Saturday, March 20, 1999

   Fixed silly bug in return from execute, where multiline
   return values would not return (added /s so . would match \n)
   (John Moreno <phenix@interpath.com>).


* v0.50, Friday, March 12, 1999

   Changed around the argument order for osa_script() and
   compile_osa_script().

   Added load_osa_script() function.

   Added save() method.

   Added lots of tests.


* v0.10, Tuesday, March 9, 1999

   Added lots of stuff to get compiled script data.
