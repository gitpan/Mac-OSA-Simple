NAME
    Mac::OSA::Simple - Simple access to Mac::OSA

SYNOPSIS
        #!perl -wl
        use Mac::OSA::Simple;
        osa_script(<<'EOS', 'LAND');
          dialog.getInt ("Duration?",@examples.duration);
          dialog.getInt ("Amplitude?",@examples.amplitude);
          dialog.getInt ("Frequency?",@examples.frequency);
          speaker.sound (examples.duration, examples.amplitude,
              examples.frequency)
        EOS

        print frontier('clock.now()');

        applescript('beep 3');

DESCRIPTION
    Allows simple access to Mac::OSA. Just pass the script to the function
    for `frontier()' or `applescript()'. Or, pass the script and the four-
    character component ID to `osa_script()'. Functions return a value if
    there is one, or 1 if successful and there is no value.

    [Hm. Should `frontier()' and/or `osa_script($script, 'LAND')' launch
    Frontier if it is not running?]

    Also note that you can get the raw data of a compiled script with:

        $script = compile_applescript($script_text);
        $raw_data = $script->compiled;

    (There are also `compile_frontier' and `compile_osa_script').

    `$script' there is an object with parameters like `SCRIPT' (the AEDesc
    containing the compiled script), `COMP' (the scripting component),
    `ID' (the script ID), and `TEXT' (the text of the script).

    You can manually dispose of the OSA script and the AEDesc with
    `$script->dispose', or let it get disposed of during object
    destruction.

    You can access scripting components via the tied hash
    `%ScriptComponents' which is automatically exported. Components are
    only opened if they have not been already, and are closed when the
    program exits.

TODO
    Add OSALoad stuff so compiled scripts from resource forks etc. can
    files can be used.

HISTORY

        Added lots of stuff to get compiled script data.
